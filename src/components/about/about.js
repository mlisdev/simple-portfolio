          <h1>About Steph</h1>
                I am a solutions-oriented software engineer, dedicated to problem solving and clean design.
              <blockquote>I am "a victim of a series of accidents, as are we all.‚Äù
              - Vonnegut.

              <p>
                After working with community colleges for years, I decided I wanted to get my Master's Degree and explore a second career. I earned my MLIS in 2018 and it's the single thing I'm most proud of in this world.
                   </p>
              <p>
                I have worked in jobs focused on partnership management, relationship building, and customer success.
                 </p>
              <p>
                I believe front end web design should be ADA accessible, crisp, and clear.
              Back end web development should be secure, easy to navigate, and designed to improve the user experience.
              </p>
